\section*{Problem 1}



\subsubsection*{(a)}
What are the goals of their simulation study and what are the metrics that they consider in
assessing their method?

\subsubsection*{(b)}
What choices did the authors have to make in designing their simulation study? What are the
key aspects of the data generating mechanism that likely affect the statistical power of the test?

\subsubsection*{(c)}
Suggest some alternatives to how the authors designed their study. Are there data-generating
scenarios that they did not consider that would be useful to consider?

\subsubsection*{(d)}
Give some thoughts on how to set up a simulation study for their problem that uses principles of
basic experimental design (see the Unit 10 notes) or if you think it would be difficult, say why.

\subsubsection*{(e)}
Do their figures/tables do a good job of presenting the simulation results and do you have any
alternative suggestions for how to do this? Do the authors address the issue of simulation uncertainty/
simulation standard errors and/or do they convince the reader they¡¯ve done enough
simulation replications?

\subsubsection*{(f)}
Interpret their tables on power (Tables 4 and 6) - do the results make sense in terms of how the
power varies as a function of the data generating mechanism?

\subsubsection*{(g)}
Discuss the extent to which they follow JASA¡¯s guidelines on simulation studies (see the end of
the Unit 10 notes for the JASA guidelines).
